# Langs_Renpy_Prototype
 Langs' initial prototype implemented by [Renpy](https://www.renpy.org/)

 Langs is a language-learning game app, users interact with NPCs and complete tasks in different real-life scenarios to learn practical sayings which would allow them to thrive when they arrive in the destination country. Learning principles like spaced repetition & far transfer are also incorporated to boost your learning experience.

 If you are an English speaker who are learning Mandarin and would like to practice listening & speaking through games in real-life scenarios. This app is for you! 

 You can enjoy the game here!
